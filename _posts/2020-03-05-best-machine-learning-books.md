## Deep Learning

![Front cover of "Deep Learning"](/assets/images/content/images/2019/02/book.jpg)Front cover of "Deep Learning"

**Authors** : [Ian Goodfellow](https://ai.google/research/people/105214), [Yoshua Bengio](https://mila.quebec/en/person/bengio-yoshua/), [Aaron Courville](https://mila.quebec/en/person/aaron-courville/).  
  
**Category:** Deep Learning.  
  
****Why you should read it** :**  
  
This book is widely considered to be the Bible of Deep Learning. Written by three experts, including one of the godfathers of the field, this is the most comprehensive book you can find on the subject. The book is extremely technical & full of math, but the authors do a great job at explaining everything.

But it’s definitely not recommended reading if you’re just starting your Deep Learning journey or if you lack a solid algebraic foundation.  
  
**Where you can get it** : [Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618/) or [read here for _**free**_](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) _**.**_  
  
**Supplement:** You can also find the [lectures with slides](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/lecture_slides.html) and [exercises](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/exercises.html) [on GitHub](https://github.com/goodfeli/dlbook_exercises).

**Book abstract:**

> Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning.  
>   
> The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.  
>   
> __Deep Learning__ can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.

If _Deep Learning_ is considered the Bible of that subject, this masterpiece earns that title for Reinforcement Learning. If you want to get started in RL, this is the way. Just like you may have predicted (pat on the back for you), this is a pretty technical read. Our advice is to take a break after each chapter, load up on the coffee, and actually implement the algorithms (à la these [famous](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction) [repo](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning)s).  
  
**Where you can get it** : Buy on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262039249/). You can [read the final draft of 2nd edition](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf) **_for free._**

**Book abstract:**

> Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In _Reinforcement Learning_ , Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics.  
>   
> Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.

**Categories:** Machine Learning, Edge Deployment.  
  
****Why you should read it** :**  
  
“[Why the future of Machine Learning is tiny](https://petewarden.com/2018/06/11/why-the-future-of-machine-learning-is-tiny/)” was published by Pete about a year ago, but that article is still of great relevance and importance right now, as its central thesis remains true: "there’s a massive untapped market waiting to be unlocked with the right technology."

In this book, Pete and his co-author argue that the reason to deploy at the edge is pretty simple: given the Industry 4.0 trends about IoT, there are billions of micro-controllers out there with hardcoded tasks that consume thousands of sensor data per second, but most of this data is unfortunately wasted.

But what technology is able to process multiple data and at the same time make autonomous decisions? Bingo, Machine Learning models. Recent techniques are making deep learning models smaller & smaller without losing accuracy, and this book’s authors will show you how to do it properly. If you want to be at the forefront of the next ML disruption, you’ll want to prepare yourself with this book.

**Where you can get it** : Buy on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/TinyML-Learning-TensorFlow-Ultra-Low-Power-Microcontrollers/dp/1492052043) or [O'Reilly Shop](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920254508.do).

**Book abstract:**

> This book, together with specially prepared online material freely accessible to our readers, provides a complete introduction to Machine Learning, the technology that enables computational systems to adaptively improve their performance with experience accumulated from the observed data. Such techniques are widely applied in engineering, science, finance, and commerce. This book is designed for a short course on machine learning. It is a short course, not a hurried course. From over a decade of teaching this material, we have distilled what we believe to be the core topics that every student of the subject should know. In addition, our readers are given free access to online e-Chapters that we update with the current trends in Machine Learning, such as deep learning and support vector machines. We chose the title `learning from data' that faithfully describes what the subject is about, and made it a point to cover the topics in a story-like fashion. Our hope is that the reader can learn all the fundamentals of the subject by reading the book cover to cover. Learning from data has distinct theoretical and practical tracks. In this book, we balance the theoretical and the practical, the mathematical and the heuristic. Theory that establishes the conceptual framework for learning is included, and so are heuristics that impact the performance of real learning systems. What we have emphasized are the necessary fundamentals that give any student of learning from data a solid foundation. The authors are professors at California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), and National Taiwan University (NTU), where this book is the text for their popular courses on machine learning. The authors also consult extensively with financial and commercial companies on machine learning applications, and have led winning teams in machine learning competitions.

## The Book of Why

![](/assets/images/content/images/2019/02/book7.jpg)Front Cover of "The Book Of Why"

**Authors** : [Judea Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html), [Dana Mackenzie](http://danamackenzie.com/).  
  
**Categories:** Data Science, AI and Machine Learning.  
  
****Why you should read it** :**  
  
This is the most controversial book on our list. The author introduces the causality framework to overcome curve-fitting of ML/DL models and his views on the path to achieve Artificial General Intelligence. This is the right book if you are looking for something to make you think (a lot)!  
  
**Where you can get it** : Buy on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/046509760X).

**Book abstract:**

> "Correlation is not causation." This mantra, chanted by scientists for more than a century, has led to a virtual prohibition on causal talk. Today, that taboo is dead. The causal revolution, instigated by Judea Pearl and his colleagues, has cut through a century of confusion and established causality--the study of cause and effect--on a firm scientific basis. His work explains how we can know easy things, like whether it was rain or a sprinkler that made a sidewalk wet; and how to answer hard questions, like whether a drug cured an illness. Pearl's work enables us to know not just whether one thing causes another: it lets us explore the world that is and the worlds that could have been. It shows us the essence of human thought and key to artificial intelligence. Anyone who wants to understand either needs __The Book of Why__.

## Rebooting AI

### Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust

![Front Cover of "Rebooting AI"](/assets/images/content/images/2020/02/rebootingai.jpg)Front Cover of "Rebooting AI"

**Author** : [Gary Marcus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-marcus-b6384b4/) & Ernest Davis.  
  
**Categories:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence.  
  
****Why you should read it** :**  
  
What are we missing in order to achieve a robust AI model? Is Deep Learning enough, or just one part of the solution? According to the authors, Hybrid AI is important, but they argue that it is a necessary but not sufficient condition to achieve a robust AI model.

Similarly to _The Book of Why_ , this book aims to open up a debate between symbolic & connectionist AI, using actionable research to explore what we could and should try next to reach AGI.

Marcus’s position is to have us take a seat while he talks to us and tries to convince us that we need hybrid AI. On the other side, we have Bengio who said, "I don't care what words you want to use, I'm just trying to build something that works." _Rebooting AI_ certainly enriches the debate.

**Book Abstract:**

> Two leaders in the field offer a compelling analysis of the current state of the art and reveal the steps we must take to achieve a truly robust artificial intelligence.  
>   
> Despite the hype surrounding AI, creating an intelligence that rivals or exceeds human levels is far more complicated than we have been led to believe. Professors Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis have spent their careers at the forefront of AI research and have witnessed some of the greatest milestones in the field, but they argue that a computer beating a human in Jeopardy does not signal that we are on the doorstep of fully autonomous cars or superintelligent machines. The achievements thus far have occurred in closed systems with fixed sets of rules, and these approaches are too narrow to achieve genuine intelligence.  
>   
> The world we live in is wildly complex and open-ended. How can we bridge this gap? What will the consequences be when we do? Marcus and Davis show us what we need to accomplish before we can get there and argue that if we are wise along the way, we need not worry about a future of machine overlords; we will be able to create an AI that we can trust in our homes, our cars, and our doctor's offices. Rebooting AI provides a lucid, clear-eyed assessment of the current science and offers an inspiring vision of how AI can make our lives better.

Book announcement

**Book abstract:**

> Machine learning has great potential for improving products, processes and research. But ****computers usually do not explain their predictions**** which is a barrier to the adoption of machine learning. This book is about making machine learning models and their decisions interpretable.  
>   
> After exploring the concepts of interpretability, you will learn about simple, ****interpretable models** **such as decision trees, decision rules and linear regression. Later chapters focus on general model-agnostic methods for ****interpreting black box models**** like feature importance and accumulated local effects and explaining individual predictions with Shapley values and LIME.  
>   
> All interpretation methods are explained in depth and discussed critically. How do they work under the hood? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How can their outputs be interpreted? This book will enable you to select and correctly apply the interpretation method that is most suitable for your machine learning project.  
>   
> The book focuses on machine learning models for tabular data (also called relational or structured data) and less on computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Reading the book is recommended for machine learning practitioners, data scientists, statisticians, and anyone else interested in making machine learning models interpretable.

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning

![](/assets/images/content/images/2019/02/tikz11.png)This book doesn't have a front cover, but a neural network is always better than nothing :)

**Author** : [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/)  
  
**Categories:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning.  
  
****Why you should read it:****

_Neural Networks and Deep Learning_ is **THE** free online book. Period.  
  
**Where you can get it** : [You can read it **_for free_**](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html).  
  
**Supplement:** You can find the companion [code on Github](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning).

**Book abstract:**

> Neural networks are one of the most beautiful programming paradigms ever invented. In the conventional approach to programming, we tell the computer what to do, breaking big problems up into many small, precisely defined tasks that the computer can easily perform. By contrast, in a neural network we don't tell the computer how to solve our problem. Instead, it learns from observational data, figuring out its own solution to the problem at hand.  
>   
> Automatically learning from data sounds promising. However, until 2006 we didn't know how to train neural networks to surpass more traditional approaches, except for a few specialized problems. What changed in 2006 was the discovery of techniques for learning in so-called deep neural networks. These techniques are now known as deep learning. They've been developed further, and today deep neural networks and deep learning achieve outstanding performance on many important problems in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. They're being deployed on a large scale by companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook.  
>   
> The purpose of this book is to help you master the core concepts of neural networks, including modern techniques for deep learning. After working through the book you will have written code that uses neural networks and deep learning to solve complex pattern recognition problems. And you will have a foundation to use neural networks and deep learning to attack problems of your own devising
