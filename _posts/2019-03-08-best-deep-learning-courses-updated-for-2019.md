## CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

![Landing page of "CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning"](/assets/images/content/images/2020/03/cs224n.png)Landing page of "_CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning_ "

  * **Authors** : [Christopher Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/), [Abigail See](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/abisee/#one), [Richard Socher](https://www.socher.org/)
  * **Offered By** : Stanford University
  * **Where to start** : [Course website](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)
  * **Certification** : Only for Stanford Students
  * **Supplement:**[Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z&fbclid=IwAR2f5afK7gZkP98Zlw06P7lN1OkqwV4FC7Xu0g38Y4oetiiThZJf8j8k348) (2019),****[Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6) (2017)
  * **Suggested** **Duration:** 3 months
  * **Categories:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing
  * **Requirements:**

**Proficiency in Python**

  * All class assignments will be in Python (using NumPy and PyTorch). If you need to remind yourself of Python, or you're not very familiar with NumPy, you can come to the Python review session in week 1 (listed in the [schedule](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/#schedule)). If you have a lot of programming experience but in a different language (e.g. C/C++/Matlab/Java/Javascript), you will probably be fine.

**College Calculus, Linear Algebra** (e.g. MATH 51, CME 100)

  * You should be comfortable taking (multivariable) derivatives and understanding matrix/vector notation and operations.

**Basic Probability and Statistics** (e.g. CS 109 or equivalent)

  * You should know basics of probabilities, gaussian distributions, mean, standard deviation, etc.

**Foundations of Machine Learning** (e.g. CS 221 or CS 229)

  * We will be formulating cost functions, taking derivatives and performing optimization with gradient descent. If you already have basic machine learning and/or deep learning knowledge, the course will be easier; however it is possible to take CS224n without it. There are many introductions to ML, in webpage, book, and video form. One approachable introduction is Hal Daumé's in-progress [_A Course in Machine Learning_](http://ciml.info/). Reading the first 5 chapters of that book would be good background. Knowing the first 7 chapters would be even better!

This is one of the best course available to get you up to speed on the state of the art in NLP. Not an easy course by any means since it has a lot of requirements and it’s really technical, but on the other end of it, you’ll know how Deep Learning is shaping NLP. 

I owe personal thanks Chris & Richard (ex co-instructor and now chief scientist at Salesforce) to make this course available online - it was one of the things I started with in my early days as a DL student.

**Recommended for:**

  * Everyone with solid ML and Python foundations who wants to get into the current state-of-the-art of Deep Learning for NLP

**About this course:**

> Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies of the information age, and a crucial part of artificial intelligence. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate almost everything in language: web search, advertising, emails, customer service, language translation, medical reports, etc. In recent years, Deep Learning approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks, using single end-to-end neural models that do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In this course, students will gain a thorough introduction to cutting-edge research in Deep Learning for NLP. Through lectures, assignments and a final project, students will learn the necessary skills to design, implement, and understand their own neural network models. This year, CS224n will be taught for the first time using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) rather than TensorFlow (as in previous years).

## CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

  * **Suggested** **Duration:** 3 months
  * **Categories:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision(CV)
  * **Requirements:**

**Proficiency in Python, high-level familiarity in C/C++**

  * All class assignments will be in Python (and use numpy) (we provide a tutorial [here](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) for those who aren't as familiar with Python), but some of the deep learning libraries we may look at later in the class are written in C++. If you have a lot of programming experience but in a different language (e.g. C/C++/Matlab/Javascript) you will probably be fine.

**College Calculus, Linear Algebra (e.g. MATH 19 or 41, MATH 51)**

  * You should be comfortable taking derivatives and understanding matrix vector operations and notation.

**Basic Probability and Statistics (e.g. CS 109 or other stats course)**

  * You should know basics of probabilities, gaussian distributions, mean, standard deviation, etc.

**Equivalent knowledge of CS229 (Machine Learning)**

  * We will be formulating cost functions, taking derivatives and performing optimization with gradient descent.

Similarly to CS224n this course is really technical and requires strong foundations, but this course will rocket you to frontiers of Deep Learning for CV.

The first time I watched it, [Andrej Karpathy](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/) was a co-instructor (now he is the Director of AI at Tesla). [You can find the old lectures on his Youtube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC)

**Recommended for:**

  * Everyone with solid ML and Python foundations who wants to get into the current state-of-the-art of Deep Learning for CV

**About this course:**

> _Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent developments in neural network (aka “deep learning”) approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. During the 10-week course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. The final assignment will involve training a multi-million parameter convolutional neural network and applying it on the largest image classification dataset (ImageNet). We will focus on teaching how to set up the problem of image recognition, the learning algorithms (e.g. backpropagation), practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning the networks and guide the students through hands-on assignments and a final course project. Much of the background and materials of this course will be drawn from the_[ _ImageNet Challenge_](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/index) _._

Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include:_  
>   
> _(i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks)._  
> _(ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning)._  
> _(iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI)._  
>   
> _The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas._
