## Founder's Note

We started FloydHub in 2016 because we were passionate about helping everyone build amazing and impactful AI applications. So we set out to build a productivity platform for data scientists, like Heroku had done for web developers. Over the next 5 years, we had the honor of supporting over a hundred thousand users train their AI models on FloydHub.  
  
The AI market is still in its nascency and we faced several challenges. We worked very hard to make FloydHub successful. But, in spite of our efforts and enthusiastic usage by many of you, we couldn't build a sustainable business. After considerable thought, we've decided to shutdown FloydHub.  
  
We continue to be huge cheerleaders of AI - the technology, the community and the amazing applications you all continue to build. We're grateful for the opportunity to have played a small part in this revolution. We are sad to say goodbye, but we're excited to see what the future holds for us all.  
  
Until next time,  
Sai & Naren
